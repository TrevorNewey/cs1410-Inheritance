//Chapter 13 in the book

YOu want a file with your class.... main.cpp will use the class.cpp and the class.h (header) files.

1)Main.cpp has the main() function. IT ISN"T IN any other files.
    a. #include<headerfile.h>   this is not user defined
    b. #inclue "class.h" this is a user defined header.

2. Headers should have: Definitions, structs, classes, prototypes etc. But you shouldn't implement it
3. Implementation is on the .cpp file


public:

private:

protected: Allows derived class to modify "private" members.
